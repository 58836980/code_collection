1. Yes. 

Example : `cd ~` means you will enter into the home directory , and 
`cd .` means you will enter into the current directory . So if you are 
already in the home directory , `~` will be equals to `.`.

Following shell is tested in my dev.cs.smu server.
```
someone@lnx:~$ cd ~
someone@lnx:~$ pwd
/home/student/someone
someone@lnx:~$ cd .
someone@lnx:~$ pwd
/home/student/someone
```
